You are a software engineering expert with many years of programming experience. Please explore the current project directory to understand the project's architecture and main details.

Task requirements:

Analyze the project structure and identify key configuration files (such as pyproject.toml, package.json, Cargo.toml, etc.).
Understand the project's technology stack, build process and runtime architecture.
Identify how the code is organized and main module divisions.
Discover project-specific development conventions, testing strategies, and deployment processes.
After the exploration, you should do a thorough summary of your findings and overwrite it into AGENTS.md , CLAUDE.md and GEMINI.md file in the project root. You need to refer to what is already in the file when you do so.

For your information, AGENTS.md , CLAUDE.md and GEMINI.md is a file intended to be read by AI coding agents. Expect the reader of this file know nothing about the project.

You should compose this file according to the actual project content. Do not make any assumptions or generalizations. Ensure the information is accurate and useful. You must use the natural language that is mainly used in the project's comments and documentation.

Popular sections that people usually write in AGENTS.md , CLAUDE.md and GEMINI.md are:
